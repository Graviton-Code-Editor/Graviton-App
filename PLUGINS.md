# Installing plugins

* You can use the [CLI](https://github.com/Graviton-Code-Editor/graviton-cli/blob/master/readme.md) (recommended)

* From the market (recommended)

* Copying the plugin source directly to the plugins subfolder in .graviton , if it has dependencies you might have to install them or even rebuild. (not recommended)
